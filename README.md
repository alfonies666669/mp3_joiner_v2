# Program for joining multiple .mp3 files v2
In this version of the application, a separate installation of the library "FFmpeg" is no longer required.
This version works entirely through the Windows console, which eliminates the need for additional libraries.

It is enough only when launching to pass the path to the folder and the number of merged files, and you can also optionally choose to create a new folder to transfer the merged files there, as well as delete old files
